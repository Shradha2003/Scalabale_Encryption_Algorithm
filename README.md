## Overview

SEA_ALGORITHM is implemented in Verilog and includes several submodules to handle different parts of the encryption and decryption processes. The algorithm uses a series of cryptographic operations, including addition, substitution, bit rotation, XOR, and word rotation.

## Features

- Supports 256-bit input data and 256-bit key.
- Configurable number of encryption rounds.
- Modular design with reusable submodules.
- Easy integration into larger systems.


### Prerequisites

- Verilog simulator or synthesis tool (e.g., ModelSim, Xilinx Vivado)
- Basic understanding of Verilog and digital design.
